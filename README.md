# EDA-Poisonous-Mushroom-Classification
This project uses data science to predict if a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on features like color, shape, and texture. Weâ€™re analyzing a unique dataset created by a deep learning model, similar to a well-known dataset. Our approach includes (EDA) and data cleaning to build an accurate model for identifying safe mushrooms.
