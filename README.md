# EDA-Poisonous-Mushroom-Classification
This project uses data science to predict if a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on features like color, shape, and texture. Weâ€™re analyzing a unique dataset created by a deep learning model, similar to a well-known dataset. Our approach includes (EDA) and data cleaning to build an accurate model for identifying safe mushrooms.

Certainly! Here's a README file template for your Kaggle notebook on the classification of mushroom data:

## Overview

This project is focused on the binary classification of mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. The dataset used in this analysis was provided by Kaggle and is a modified version of the original UCI Mushroom dataset. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies mushrooms into the correct category.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Mushroom dataset, which includes the following features:
- Cap shape
- Cap color
- Gill size
- Stalk shape
- Spore print color
- Odor
- And several other physical attributes

The target variable is binary:
- `e` for edible
- `p` for poisonous

## Installation

To run the notebook in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `xgboost`
- `lightgbm`

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Exploratory Data Analysis section covers the initial investigation of the dataset, including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of the relationship between various features
- Detection and treatment of missing values
- Identification of patterns that may help in the classification task

## Modeling

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated for the classification task:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **LightGBM**

Each model was trained and validated using cross-validation techniques, and the best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**

The evaluation focused on the ability of the models to accurately predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## Results

The results of the modeling process are presented, including:
- Confusion matrix for the best-performing model
- Feature importance rankings
- A comparison of the performance of different models

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous. The selected model achieved high accuracy and reliability, making it a viable solution for mushroom classification tasks.

## Future Work

Potential future enhancements to the project include:
- Implementing additional machine learning models and ensemble techniques.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to further improve model performance.
- Expanding the analysis to include more advanced deep learning models.
- Exploring the use of external datasets to enhance the model's generalizability.
